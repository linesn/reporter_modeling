# Reporter Modeling
An elementary Bayesian approach to model the information intake of a news reporter and prune sources. You may
wish to start with [the paper on this work](https://github.com/linesn/reporter_modeling/blob/main/Documents/Final_Paper_With_Appendix.pdf).

# Reproducing these results
This code was run on a 4-core Ubuntu machine. To reproduce it you can instantiate the Conda environment with
```Bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pgm
```
You should then be able to run all the code in the Notebooks directory with Jupyter.
